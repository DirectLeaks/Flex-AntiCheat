Welcome to my AntiCheat project called Flex. In this project, I optimize AntiCheats with better and advanced configs.

This, of course, helps to reduce false positives and bypasses. And what's beautiful is that it's completely free.

Currently there is an [AAC]() and [AntiAura]() version.


![About-Flex](https://directleaks.com/attachments/about-flex-png.41190/)

Flex AntiCheat has started on 15-03-2017 on BlackSpigotMC and has been in development since then.

It was so popular that I decided to place it on multiple sites including DirectLeaks and now GitHub.

Currently we already have version 3 and already have almost 10000 total downloads on all versions that have ever been released.
